TOFU Knowledge Layer Experiment
================================================================================
Pretrained (no TOFU):   meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
Full (has TOFU):        open-unlearning/tofu_Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_full
Examples: 10, Layers: 0-15
Output: runs/knowledge_layers_20260106_142927
================================================================================

[1/4] Loading tokenizer...
[2/4] Loading pretrained model (no TOFU knowledge)...
[3/4] Loading TOFU full model (has TOFU knowledge)...
[INFO] Model has 16 layers, testing: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
[4/4] Loading TOFU forget10 dataset...

================================================================================
OPTION A: Pretrained → Full
  Source: Pretrained (NO TOFU knowledge)
  Target: Full (HAS TOFU knowledge)
  Question: Which layers STORE the TOFU knowledge?
  Interpretation: If patching breaks accuracy, that layer stores knowledge
